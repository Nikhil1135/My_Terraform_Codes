AUTO SCALING GROUPS - Interview Questions
=========================================================================

Section 1: Core Concept Questions
------------------------------------------

What is an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) in AWS? How does it work with EC2 instances?

What are the different types of scaling policies available in ASG? Can you explain each with a use case?

How does AWS ensure high availability using ASG and Load Balancers together?

What’s the difference between a launch template and a launch configuration in ASG? Which one should you prefer and why?


Section 2: Scenario-Based Questions
-------------------------------------------
Imagine your application is receiving a sudden spike in traffic. How would an ASG with an Application Load Balancer respond? Walk me through the flow.

You have an ASG with min=2, max=6. A deployment went wrong and crashed all instances. Your health checks are set only at the ELB level. What happens next?

You need to deploy a service that handles critical banking transactions. How would you design the ASG and Load Balancer setup to ensure high availability and minimal downtime during deployments?


Section 3: Advanced & DevOps-Oriented
-------------------------------------------
How do lifecycle hooks work in an ASG, and what can they be used for during scale-out or scale-in events?

Can you explain how target groups and listeners work in relation to an Application Load Balancer?

How would you use CloudWatch and ASG policies to create a cost-effective auto-scaling solution for a workload that has predictable traffic spikes every weekday from 9AM to 5PM?


Section 4: Tricky/Thought Provoking
--------------------------------------------
Can an instance be part of multiple ASGs at once? Why or why not?

What would happen if you deregister a healthy instance from a target group attached to an ALB while it’s still part of an ASG?

Let’s say a target in your ALB is failing health checks, but the EC2 status checks are passing. What does that imply, and what should you investigate?
